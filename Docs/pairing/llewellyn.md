# llewellyn Pairing

Taken from: http://llewellynfalco.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/llewellyns-strong-style-pairing.html


The golden rule for this style of pairing is:

"For an idea to go from your head into the computer 
it MUST go through someone else's hands"


## The Process

This style is actually very close to an actual navigator / driver situation in a car or on a boat. With all the high level commands coming from the navigator and the lower level implementation happening from the driver.

This style of programming is all about increasing communication and collaboration. Verbally communicating code and editor commands is a skill like anything else but it is one that many people have not developed yet. Don't worry, it's pretty easy to gain and most people pick it up the basics in a few hours.


## The Driver
As a driver (at the keyboard) this is a fairly simple and peaceful place to be. I have been the driver in languages and editors I was completely unfamiliar with without problem or indecent. However, there are two important things that are required for a happy driver experience.

"Trust your navigator"
When you are the driver trust that your navigator knows what they are telling you. If you don't understand what they are telling you ask questions, but if you don't understand why they are telling you something don't worry about it until you've finished the method or section of code. The right time to discuss and challenge design decisions is after the solution is out of the navigators head or when the navigator is confused and unable to navigate.

"Become comfortable working with incomplete understanding"
Even if you trust the navigator, the navigator might not be comfortable navigating you in this strong style. To combat this they might try to explain everything to you before you can actually start to code. This slows things down a lot and depending on your level of knowledge can taking hours or even days before you can even start. Don't worry about knowing everything, you will learn as you go. Don't worry about not knowing stuff. You might not know the language, os, editor, code, or even the problem space you are working in. It's ok, you will soon.


"What if I have an idea I want to implement?"
Great! Switch places and become the navigator.


## The Navigator
As the navigator you have two main jobs.

Give the next instruction to the driver the instant they are ready to implement it
Talk in the highest level of abstraction the driver can understand
The navigator is essentially managing a ToDo list in their heads. As you go through the code you keep adding things to the list and as the driver is typing you keep removing the completed items from the list. The key is while you are handling and tracking 2-20 things at a time, the driver is only ever responsible for 1 thing. This is the key to letting the driver stay in a state of flow. This is the number one main job for the navigator; Manage the big picture details so the driver can stay focused on the code they are typing. 

The second job of the navigator is to speak at the highest level of abstraction that the driver is able to digest at the moment. This will change by driver, of course, but it will also change during the day for the same driver. 
For example, a navigator might tell the the driver "extract that method" to which they might get a blank stare. The navigator should then restate that intention at a low level of abstraction. Such as "ctrl+alt+m" or even "highlight lines 14-20 and then press ctrl+alt+m". After doing that a few times the navigator should be able to revert back to the higher level of "extract that method" but always realize that later the driver might be tired or just plain forgetful, adjust accordingly. 

It is the navigators responsibility to communicate in a meaningful way. This means you shouldn't be speaking above the drivers understanding. However, it is also the navigators responsibility to be ever increasing the the level of communication and understanding. Stay mindful of the driver and be constantly adjusting to them.

### "Just do it"
Although you are the navigator, you are going to make mistakes and bad decisions. Correct them when you do but don't sit around and plan to try to avoid.  When someone has an idea have them take the navigator role and go. once it's out look back with the benefit of  hindsight and refactor or redo it so it's better.
