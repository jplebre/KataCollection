## How to

This is primarily the same as ping-pong pairing. 
Work in pairs (should be a given anyway)

* Person A writes the first test.
* Person B gets the test to pass as simply as possible.
* Person B *can* do *some* refactoring.
* Person B writes the next test.
* Loop

The additional constraints are:

- No talking - You are only allowed to communicate with each other except through code
- No code comments (or strings pretending to be comments).


The goal is to practice writing tests & code as expressively as possible.
