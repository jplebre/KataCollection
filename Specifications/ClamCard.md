# ClamCard

## Background Info

Make your own implementation of the OysterCard system :)
Implement a system for a contactless travel card for the London underground.

## Specification

* The card does not need to be topped up.
* The card charges the owner's bank account directly when used.
* The card is used by touching in and out at train stations.
* The train system accepting this card has two categorical zones of stations, Zone A and Zone B.
* The stations within the zones are as follows:

|Zone A         |     Zone B     |
|---------------|----------------|
|Asterisk       |     Bison      |
|Amersham       |     Bugel      |
|Aldgate        |     Balham     | 
|Angel          |     Bullhead   |
|Anerley        |     Barbican   |

* Travelling within zone B is more expensive than travelling in Zone A.
* The price of zone B is inclusive of travelling within zone A.
* If one of the stations is within Zone 2 at any point in a journey, the price for zone 2 will be charged.
* The fares are as described below:

|  Zone  |  Single  |   Day   |    Week    |     Month   |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| ZoneA  |  £2.50   |  £7.00  |   £40.00   |    £145.00  |
| ZoneB  |  £3.00   |  £8.00  |   £47.00   |    £165.00  |

* A Single is a journey from one station to another.
* A Day fare includes all single journies made within a single day.
* A Week fare includes all single journies made within a single week.
* A month fare includes all single journies made within a single month.
* No matter how many journies are made within one of the time boundaries within a particular zone, the price will cap at that time period's fare.
