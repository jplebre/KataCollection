# Conway's Game of Life
This kata is not for the faint of heart :)

## Background Information
* The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells.
* Each cell is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. 
* Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours: cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 
* At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
  * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours **dies**, as if caused by under-population.
  * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours **lives** on to the next generation.
  * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours **dies**, as if by over-population.
  * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

* The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. 
* The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). 
* Repeat to create further generations.

* There should be no explosive growth.
* There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes.
* There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors.

### Patterns:
* Still patterns: Block, Behive, Float, Boat
* Oscillator patterns: Pulsar, beacon, blinker, toad, pulsar, pentadecathlon
* Spaceship patterns: Glider, LightWeight SpaceShip (LWSS)

## Further Challenges:
Here are some things that you should try when solving this kata (these rules can be used with any kata):
- Don't use any primitive types
- Don't use any if/else statements
- No method can have more than 4 lines
