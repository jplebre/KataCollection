# Jelly vs Tower

## Background Info

## Specification

## Test Data

## Use Case Scenarios

Based on a board game, similar to the JellyDefense mobile game.
Towers are setup in a map defend a town against incoming jellies.
Create a console application (or GUI if you are up for it).
Damaged is related to tower and jelly level, as well as their colour.

* Ensure jellies and towers can be of different colours: **Blue**, **Red**, **RedBlue**.
* Jellies and Towers should have a health and be alive or dead.
* Provide a way to identify each individual tower and Jelly.

  ```
  Blue Red Tower 1 : Level 1 
  Blue Tower 1 : Level 2 
  Blue Tower 2 : Level 4
  Red Tower 1 : Level 1
  ```
  
* Implement a game script that creates towers and Jellies and outputs something like:
  ```
  Blue Red Tower attacks Jelly for 1 point damage. 
  Blue Tower attacks Jelly for 2 points damage. 
  Blue Tower attacks Jelly for 2 points damage. 
  Red Tower attacks Jelly for 2 points damage.
  ```

* Make sure the following rules apply:<br>
