## Background Info

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet. Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.


## Specification

- Develop an api that moves a rover around a grid.
- You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a character array of commands.
- Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
- Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
- The only commands you can give the rover are f,b,l, and r.
- Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.
Here is an example:
- Let's say that the rover is located at 0,0 facing North on a 100x100 grid.
- Given the command "ffrff" would put the rover at 2,2 facing East.

### Tips

Don't worry about the structure of the rover. Let the structure evolve as you add more tests. 
Don't start up/use the debugger, use your tests to implement the kata. 
If you find that you run into issues, use your tests to assert on the inner workings of the rover (as opposed to starting the debugger).
