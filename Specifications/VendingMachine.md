# Vending Machine Kata - Exploring Behaviors
## Specification
Use this kata to spec out how you want your vending machine to work.
* Vending machine can be stocked with an assortment of items.
* An item is dispensed if a valid slot is picked and enough money has been inserted into the machine.
* The vending machine tells you if you've selected an item that is currently out of stock.
* The vending machine accepts dollars, quarters, dimes and nickels and will dispense change if change is due.
* Context Specification

## Tips
There is an approach to test driven development called context specification. 
The idea with context specification is to describe a small part of the system and then implement it. 
After you have a simple test passing, elaborate on that behavior by introducing a nested context.
Use the Vending Machine kata to explore context specification. 
Find out how many nested contexts you want to create before things get hard to maintain.
